Hello! I'm Brittany and by day I work at [Google as a Data Center Technician](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/), and by night I novels, novellas, short stories, and how-to guides. You can purchase my books on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Brittany-Gates/author/B005CKTPQI), and read my [short stories](https://bcgates.com/#short-stories) for free.

I'm currently refreshing my programming skills using FreeCodeCamp, and you can follow along by reviewing my [progress](https://www.freecodecamp.org/bcgates82) as I go through each certification. I also post updates using the #100DaysOfCode hashtag on Twitter and LinkedIn. (Yes, I continue to call the site Twitter as I'm an ex-Twitter employee from the Atlanta Data Center (10/17 to 12/20) so it will always be Twitter to me.)

I recently deleted a bunch of my old repos on my acccount as I only want to focus on improving the three web apps I run currently online:

* [Black History Facts Generator](https://www.bhfgen.com/)
* [Click-Go-Lotto](https://clickgolotto.com/)
* [Where Should I Go Eat?](https://www.whereshouldigoeat.com/)

All three web apps use Bootstrap as the frontend and Python/Flask on the backend. Also, I use Google Cloud to host/run them. Finally, I'm in the process of updating the frontend on all three. The first being Click-Go-Lotto.
