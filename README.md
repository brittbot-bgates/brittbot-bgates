Hello! I'm Brittany. I work at Google as a [Data Center Technician](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/) during the day. At night I divide up my time between improving my Python programming skills and learning other technical skills from YouTube. When I find some time I do write as that is my first love.

### Why am I improving my Python skills?
* I'm working to become a Software Engineer at Google.

### Why do I write?
* I have a B.A. in English, and wanted to a full-time author/writer. That didn't work out, so I transitioned to IT in 2008 since I learned that skill-set resolving my own computer issues.

### Other stuff about me
* I self-publish my books on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Brittany-Gates/author/B005CKTPQI) in both ebook and paperback formats.
* My short stories available to read my [website](https://brittany-gates.com/short-stories/) for free.
* I created and continue to maintain these three web apps:
    * [Quick Black History Facts](https://quickblackhistoryfacts.com/)
    * [Click-Go-Lotto](https://clickgolotto.com/)
    * [Where Should I Go Eat?](https://www.whereshouldigoeat.com/)
