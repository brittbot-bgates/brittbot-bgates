Hello! I'm Brittany and by day I work at [Google as a Data Center Technician](https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/), and by night I novels, novellas, short stories, and how-to guides. You can purchase my books on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/stores/Brittany-Gates/author/B005CKTPQI), and read my [short stories](https://bcgates.com/#short-stories) for free.

I'm currently refreshing my programming skills using FreeCodeCamp, and you can follow along by reviewing my [progress](https://www.freecodecamp.org/bcgates82) as I go through each Certification.
